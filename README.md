# Description
- This is an assembly program written for the x86 architecture, designed to implement a simple chess game with graphical output. 
- The program uses a flat memory model and follows the stdcall calling convention, which is commonly used in Windows programming.

# Library Inclusions and External Functions
- The code includes standard C library functions (msvcrt.lib) for basic operations like memory allocation (malloc), setting memory (memset), printing to the console (printf), and exiting the program (exit).
- It also includes a custom library (canvas.lib) with a function BeginDrawing to handle drawing operations, likely providing a simple framework for graphical output.
  
# Data Section
- The .data section declares static data used throughout the program, such as the window title, dimensions for the chessboard area, and initial chess piece placements on the board.
- Chess pieces are represented by numbers, with specific ranges designated for different types of pieces (e.g., black and white pieces).

# Functionalities:

- Displaying chess pieces (afisare_piese) on the board by iterating over the chessboard matrix and drawing each piece using a custom position_macro.
- Handling user interactions such as selecting and moving chess pieces. This involves determining which square of the chessboard the user has clicked on (patrat procedure) and identifying which piece, if any, is on that square (click_piesa).
- Checking the validity of a move based on the type of the piece being moved. Different procedures (cal, rege, nebun, turn, pion) implement the movement rules for each type of chess piece (e.g., knight, king, bishop, rook, pawn).
- Drawing the chessboard and the pieces on it whenever necessary (draw procedure), including after user actions.
- Main entry point (start) where the program begins execution. It allocates memory for the drawing area and calls the BeginDrawing function to start the game, passing a pointer to the draw function which handles drawing and game logic based on user input.

# Macros and Utilities
- The program uses macros (e.g., position_macro, line_horizontal, b_square) to simplify repetitive tasks like drawing graphics and updating the game state.
